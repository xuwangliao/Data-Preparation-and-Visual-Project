Goal:

The goal of this project is to try to mimic the COVID-19 Dashboard showed on the following website: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html

Aim:

The project aim is to demonstrate the ability to perform data pre-processing using a combination of python and Excel. And able to use Power BI to create high quality of data visuals. Most importantly try to gain insights from data visualization.


Data source: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

Mainly I have used (not ordered):
1.	https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/archived_data/archived_daily_case_updates
2.	https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports
3.	https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/UID_ISO_FIPS_LookUp_Table.csv


Things Considered:

1.	Use Python
	•	Concatenated over 200 CSV files into one data frame.
	•	Detected, and updated inconsistent column names and row names.
	•	Removed and duplicated rows and unnecessary columns.
	•	Changed date format and filled empty cells with zeros or blank spaces.
	•	More.

2.	Use Excel
	•	Used VLOOKUP() function to detect and import latitude and longitude information from UID_ISO_FIPS_LookUp_Table. 
	•	Created new columns/attributes: Daily_new_cases, Daily_deaths, Daily_avtives, Incidence_Rate and Case-Fatality rate from existing attributes.
	•	Included Smoothing.

3.	Use Power BI
	•	Included heat map, line chart, area chat, cards, etc.
	•	Enabled animation.
	•	Considered order hierarchy of column names.
	•	Implemented joins with two different tables via foreign key.
