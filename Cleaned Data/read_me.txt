Notes:

1.There is a little variation between two approaches, without smoothing used the raw data for 
the confirmed,total_death,total_recovery  and total_Active column. For the smoothing method, 
I used the sum of adjusted daily changes to computing those aggregation columns.

2.Files are saved as .csv and .xlsx types

3.".xlsx" files contain formulas.
